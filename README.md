### Notes
Most of the challenges I faced came from using an older version of AlamofireImage. I had to do some work to get the images to show up without causing errors. In addition, I was not able to access some of the API functionality shown in the videos because the website was not working.

### Notes
There were some issues involving getting Ruby up to date and working with the Terminal for a long time to make sure that Ruby had the right version for installing the CocoaPods. 
I had some trouble trying to get the right version of AlamofireImage that worked with my MacBook.
